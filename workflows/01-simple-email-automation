# Workflow 1: Simple AI Email Automation

> Your first automation workflow. 4 nodes. 15 minutes. Real value.

## 📋 Overview

This workflow demonstrates that you don't need complexity to create value. It takes a research topic, sends it to an AI model, and emails you the generated insights—all automatically.

**Perfect for:** First-time automation builders  
**Complexity:** ⭐ Beginner  
**Setup Time:** 15 minutes  
**Nodes:** 4

## 🎯 What This Workflow Does

1. You input a research topic (e.g., "AI agents in healthcare")
2. The workflow sends an HTTP request to Groq AI API
3. AI generates insights on your topic
4. Results are automatically emailed to you

**No manual copying. No switching between tabs. Just trigger and receive.**

## 🔧 Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- n8n account (cloud or self-hosted)
- Groq API key ([Get one here](https://groq.com/))
- Gmail account

### Step 1: Import Workflow

1. Download `workflow.json` from this folder
2. Open your n8n instance
3. Go to **Workflows** → **Import from File**
4. Select the downloaded JSON file

### Step 2: Configure Groq API

1. Go to [groq.com](https://groq.com/) and sign up
2. Generate an API key from your dashboard
3. In n8n, open the **HTTP Request** node
4. Add authentication:
   - Type: `Generic Credential Type`
   - Credential Type: `Header Auth`
   - Name: `Authorization`
   - Value: `Bearer YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY`

### Step 3: Configure Gmail

1. In n8n, open the **Send Email** node
2. Click **Create New Credential**
3. Follow the OAuth2 authentication flow
4. Grant Gmail permissions
5. Update the recipient email to your address

### Step 4: Customize Your Topic

1. Open the **Edit Fields** node
2. Update the `topic` field with your research subject
   - Example: "AI agents in healthcare"
   - Example: "Latest trends in automation"
   - Example: "Best practices for n8n workflows"

### Step 5: Test Run

1. Click **Execute Workflow**
2. Watch the nodes light up as they execute
3. Check your email inbox for AI-generated insights

## 📝 Configuration Options

### HTTP Request Node

**Groq API Endpoint:**
```
POST: https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions
```

**Request Body (Customizable):**
```json
{
  "model": "mixtral-8x7b-32768",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Provide detailed insights on: {{$json.topic}}"
    }
  ],
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "max_tokens": 1000
}
```

**Customization Options:**
- `model`: Change AI model (e.g., `llama2-70b-4096`)
- `temperature`: Adjust creativity (0.0 = focused, 1.0 = creative)
- `max_tokens`: Control response length

### Email Template

Customize the email content in the **Send Email** node:

```
Subject: AI Research: {{$json.topic}}

Hi,

Here are the AI-generated insights on "{{$json.topic}}":

{{$json.response}}

---
Automated by n8n
```

## 💡 Use Cases

### 1. Daily Research Summaries
- Topic: "Latest AI news"
- Schedule: Every morning at 8 AM
- Benefit: Stay updated without manual searching

### 2. Content Idea Generation
- Topic: "Blog post ideas about automation"
- Schedule: Weekly on Mondays
- Benefit: Never run out of content ideas

### 3. Learning New Topics
- Topic: "Explain quantum computing simply"
- Schedule: On-demand
- Benefit: Quick, digestible explanations

### 4. Market Research
- Topic: "Competitor analysis for [your industry]"
- Schedule: Weekly
- Benefit: Continuous competitive intelligence

## 🔄 Advanced Modifications

### Add Scheduling (Cron Trigger)

Replace **Manual Trigger** with **Cron Trigger**:
```
0 8 * * *  → Every day at 8:00 AM
0 9 * * 1  → Every Monday at 9:00 AM
0 */6 * * * → Every 6 hours
```

### Add Multiple Topics

Modify **Edit Fields** to process multiple topics:
```json
{
  "topics": [
    "AI trends 2025",
    "Automation best practices",
    "n8n use cases"
  ]
}
```

Add a **Split In Batches** node to process each topic separately.

### Save to Google Sheets

Add a **Google Sheets** node after the HTTP Request:
- Action: Append Row
- Columns: Topic | AI Insights | Timestamp

This creates a searchable knowledge base over time.

### Add Slack Notifications

Replace/add a **Slack** node:
- Channel: `#research-updates`
- Message: AI insights formatted for team consumption

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "HTTP Request Failed"
**Solution:** Check your Groq API key
- Verify it's correctly formatted: `Bearer sk-...`
- Ensure you have API credits remaining
- Check Groq API status page

### Issue: "Email Not Sending"
**Solution:** Re-authenticate Gmail
- Go to credentials → Gmail → Reconnect
- Ensure "Less secure app access" is enabled (if using password auth)
- Check spam folder

### Issue: "Empty Response from AI"
**Solution:** Adjust your prompt
- Make the request more specific
- Increase `max_tokens` in HTTP Request body
- Try a different AI model

### Issue: "Rate Limit Exceeded"
**Solution:** Add delays
- Insert **Wait** node between requests
- Reduce frequency if using Cron trigger
- Upgrade Groq API plan
